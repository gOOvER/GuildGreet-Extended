  As you switch between characters in different guilds, as you add and remove characters from your friend lists and as characters join and leave channels, a lot of character information assembles. Some of these characters may no longer be played, they may be deleted, renamed or transferred to the opposite faction or other servers.\r\nThis tab helps you to clean up stale characters.
